== Frequently Asked Questions ==

We're working on this feature, including support for Ad Spaces as WordPress widgets. Currently, you need to paste the code snippet for each Ad Space (found on your Ad Spaces page) into your site where you'd like the advertisement to appear. You can use the Text widget for this.
