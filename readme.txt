Skyscraper is an all-in-one revenue management platform built for websites.

== Description ==

This plugin makes it easy to install Skyscraper on your blog with minimal effort.

Currently, this plugin handles your initial global install, and gives you a one-click way to embed your Skyscraper Media Kit on your site.

A shortcode `[skyscraper-advertiser-here]` is also provided so that you can embed your Skyscraper Media Kit wherever you'd like.

This plugin is under active and frequent development.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I create/manage my Ad Spaces from my WordPress Admin? =

We're working on this feature, including support for Ad Spaces as WordPress widgets. Currently, you need to paste the code snippet for each Ad Space (found on your Ad Spaces page) into your site where you'd like the advertisement to appear. You can use the Text widget for this.
